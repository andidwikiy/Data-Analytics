## SQL Project
### [Project 1: Maven Movies Rental Company](https://github.com/andidwikiy/Maven-movies-rental-company.git)
**Project description:** This project is a case study where I address a client's requests using a dataset comprising multiple tables with different categories. The client sought detailed business insights, and I responded by extracting manager names and store addresses, detailing inventory information including film titles and costs, summarizing inventory by rating and store, and analyzing inventory diversity by replacement cost. Additionally, I compiled customer details, identified the most valuable customers by lifetime rentals and payments, listed advisors and investors with their roles and companies, and assessed the coverage of films featuring awarded actors.

**Skills:** Complex Joins, Aggregations, Grouping, and Subqueries.
